# SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-06-16

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Let a fresh Claude Code session resume TRINETRA-X with **zero reliance on chat history**. |
| **Phase** | Phase I — Scientific Validation |
| **Status** | Pre-registration **v2 SEALED**. **M0, M1, M2, M3 executed — Seal #2 recorded (`6292c018…`).** Next: **M4** (single sealed-TEST run → E1/E2). |
| **Read first** | [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) → this file → [`PHASE1_M3_PLAN.md`](./PHASE1_M3_PLAN.md) → [`PHASE1_M2_PLAN.md`](./PHASE1_M2_PLAN.md) |

> Authority order: repository documents are authoritative; the Obsidian `vault/` mirrors them; this handoff is a convenience pointer. Sealed documents govern on any conflict. Supersedes `SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-06-15.md`. **Updated end of session 2 (2026-06-16): M3 + Seal #2 added below.**

## 0. SESSION-2 UPDATE — M3 complete, Seal #2 recorded (read this first)

- **M3 — threshold calibration → Seal #2: ✅ DONE (2026-06-16).** Untrained machinery built (`research/m3_calibration/`): GP-whitened box matched-filter detector; integer-comb period + circular block bootstrap (B=1000, L_b=3·max(τ_GP,T₁₄)); pinned `transitleastsquares` 1.32 (identical both arms).
- **M1 noise model recomputed at the finalized 2.5 d window** (188/188; 0.5 d archived `data/manifests/m1/superseded_0.5d/`).
- **Null-pool contamination found + cleaned (owner-directed).** "Null" = TOI-removed only → unlabeled EBs/variables inflated T and z_mono (z⋆ robust). **Prša 2022 EB + VSX** cross-match (132) + automated EB vetting — secondary/odd-even/depth (14) → **146 excluded → cleaned 854** of a 1000-star null draw. M0 null definition **preserved**; 31 high-SDE survivors retained + audited.
- **SEALED thresholds (bootstrap B=1000 CIs):** z⋆ = **3.4** [3.30,3.40] · z_mono = **5.3** [5.0,5.8] · T = **10.74** [9.74,11.34] · α_FAP = **1%** (null exceedance 1.08%) · ε = **0.01** · N_min = **2**. **w_c** (A.5; 92.8% on Rₚ≤2 R⊕) + **π̂ = 3.17%** (A.6) from Kunimoto & Matthews (2020, arXiv:2004.05296). A.7 machine: Apple M4 (10 cores).
- **Seal #2 (threshold manifest SHA-256): `6292c018c6923d512ac9c90dd55289cc010724d9facc27dc087f7e3f20832692`** (owner-approved 2026-06-16; distinct from Seal #1 `1f2d49e1…`). Verify: `shasum -a 256 data/manifests/m3/m3_threshold_manifest_SEALED_CORE.json`. Seal record + expected-evaluation note (E1 dominated by Rₚ≤2) in `data/manifests/m3/SEAL2_RECORD.json`.
- **Anti-tuning intact:** `git diff phase1-prereg-v2` empty; **0 TEST TICs** in any M3 artifact. **TEST untouched — read for the first and only time at M4.**
- **Next: M4 — the single sealed-TEST run** against Seal #2 → E1 (recall non-inferiority) / E2 (scoped compute). No threshold/config change permitted.
- **Network note:** conditioning + catalog (MAST/Vizier) queries run **sandbox-disabled** (host network); PyPI reachable. Multiprocessing TLS uses `imap_unordered` chunksize=1.

*The sections below are the prior end-of-session-1 handoff (M0–M2), retained for context.*

---

## 1. Current repository state

- **Sealed pre-registration (v2)** — three frozen docs, byte-identical to git tag **`phase1-prereg-v2`** (commit `723087e`). Verify: `git diff phase1-prereg-v2 -- docs/SCIENTIFIC_HYPOTHESIS.md docs/TRINETRA_X_PHASE1_VALIDATION.md docs/TRINETRA_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md` (must be empty). **Do not edit without a new re-registration.**
- **GitHub** `origin = https://github.com/Ansul-S/TRINETRA-X` (`gh` authed as `Ansul-S`).
  - **Merged:** PR #1 (M0 plan + follow-ons), PR #2 (M0 execution), PR #3 (M1 conditioning), **PR #4 (M2)**.
  - **OPEN: PR #5** — lands these end-of-day docs (this handoff + the refreshed CLAUDE.md + PAPER_NOTES EF-1), which landed on the branch *after* PR #4 merged. Merge it so `main` is the clean resume point.
  - **Release asset:** `m0-manifest-v1` — the frozen M0 manifest table (not in git; git holds the hash).
- **Branch note:** end-of-day docs are in PR #5. On next session: ensure PR #5 is merged, then `git checkout main && git pull`, and branch M3 off the updated `main`.
- **Python env:** `.venv/` (gitignored) with the analysis stack installed: astroquery 0.4.11, lightkurve 2.6.0, wotan 1.10, celerite2 0.3.2, batman 2.5.1, astropy-healpix, pandas, pyarrow, pyyaml. Recreate via the per-milestone `requirements.txt` if missing.
- **Local data caches (gitignored, NOT in a fresh clone):** lightkurve LC cache, `data/processed/m1/*.npz` (conditioned residuals), `data/processed/m2/` (injected residuals), `data/manifests/m0/*.parquet`. Regenerable from the pipelines + pinned versions; the manifest table is also the `m0-manifest-v1` release asset.
- **Network:** the agent sandbox **blocks DNS to MAST/ExoFOP** (PyPI reachable). Archive queries must run **sandbox-disabled** (host network) or in the user's terminal. ExoFOP specifically times out → TOI labels come from the **NASA Exoplanet Archive TAP** instead.

## 2. Current phase & milestone

- **Phase I — Scientific Validation** (prove/falsify evidence-first routing beats full TLS on TESS).
- **Done:** M0 (manifest + split + Seal #1), M1 (Stage-0 conditioning η-sample), M2 (injection + η transit-preservation; window finalized).
- **Current/next:** **M3 — threshold calibration** on the CALIBRATION set → derive + **hash-seal** `z⋆, θ, z_mono, T, α, α_FAP, ε, τ_GP` (**Seal #2**, VAL Appendix A.10), before the single **M4** sealed-test run. TEST stays sealed until M4.

## 3. Completed work (this session)

- **M0 — Manifest freeze & leakage-safe split (Seal #1).** Sectors **S1–S3** (south, SPOC 2-min); 32,960 TICs → **22,723** after cuts; leakage-safe HEALPix nside=8 split (seed 20260615): **calibration 6,925 / test 15,798**, audit PASS. Feasibility: every period ≥500 eligible test hosts at n_tr≥2 (binding P=16 d = 5,794). **Seal #1 (manifest SHA-256): `1f2d49e194b0960f1eacb0c72c25087b4c299620e38f299e2d55706199e83f1f`** (deterministic). Tooling `research/m0_manifest/`; artifacts `data/manifests/m0/`.
- **M1 — Stage-0 conditioning (η-sample).** wotan biweight detrend + quality/momentum masks → r(t); celerite2/ACF noise model. **188/200** calibration targets: σ med 1,067 ppm, CDPP(1h) 222 ppm, τ_GP ~8 min; **99 % stationary / 88 % white**. Tooling `research/m1_conditioning/`.
- **M2 — Injection + transit-preservation (η).** batman Mandel–Agol + quadratic Claret-2017 LD; e=0, a/R⋆ from stellar density; inject into real null-pool calibration LCs → re-condition → δ_post (fixed-shape LS). **Detrend window finalized at 2.5 d.** Full η grid (30 cells × 200 inj): **gate PASS** on the measurable population. Tooling `research/m2_injection/`; artifacts `data/manifests/m2/`.

## 4. Decisions made (this session)

- **M0:** sectors S1–S3 south; cuts (TIC params required, Tmag 7–15, crowding via TIC `contratio ≤ 0.25` as the metadata proxy for CROWDSAP); HEALPix whole-block 30/70 split; no full-pool precompute (sample-first). Manifest table stored as a **release asset**, not in git (hash + provenance in git).
- **M1:** wotan biweight detrend; celerite2 noise model with **robust ACF e-folding τ_GP** (celerite2 point-fit was unreliable; kept as cross-check); η-sample-first.
- **M2 / window finalization:** provisional **0.5 d** failed long-period/shallow cells → **finalized at 2.5 d**. **η gate excludes the entire Rₚ=1 (Earth) row as noise-limited** (depth ~70–85 ppm, SNR₁~0.07–0.08, broad/non-physical η; widening cannot remedy — detectability bimodality) — **explicit row exclusion, NOT an SNR₁ threshold**. **0.5/2 retained in the gate as a documented low-SNR borderline** (η=0.892), not reclassified.
- **Process:** GSD planning machinery was **not** adopted (no `.planning/`); this repo treats Markdown docs as deliverables. PR-based landing flow used throughout.

## 5. Active blockers

- **PR #5 (end-of-day docs) needs merging** — lands this handoff + the refreshed CLAUDE.md on `main` (PR #4 / M2 already merged). Until then `main` shows the stale CLAUDE.md.
- **M3 hard prerequisite:** the M1 noise model (σ/CDPP/τ_GP) was computed at the **0.5 d** provisional window and is **superseded** — it must be **recomputed at the finalized 2.5 d window** before any M3 threshold is derived. (Noted in `m1_config.yaml` and `PHASE1_M1_PLAN.md`/`PHASE1_M2_PLAN.md`.)

## 6. Open questions

- **M3 frozen-parameter targets** (need owner sign-off before sealing): FAR target for `T` (VAL A.2 targets FAR ≤ 1 %/star on null calibration stars); detector `z⋆` target (≤ 1 expected false event per null LC, A.3); monotransit `z_mono`; routing `θ`/`N_min`; bootstrap `α_FAP` and block-length multiple (A.8); fast-path window `ε`.
- **Full-pool conditioning** — still deferred (run on demand at M3/M4); confirm this remains the plan at M3 scale.
- **EB-catalog enrichment** — M2/M3 FP labels currently = TOI FP/FA dispositions; a dedicated EB catalog (Prša et al. 2022) was deferred — decide if/when to add.
- **Literal CROWDSAP** confirmation vs the TIC `contratio` proxy — deferred to M1-at-scale.

## 7. Risks (carried forward; full register in `PHASE1_READINESS_REPORT.md` §6)

- **R-1 / compute external validity (top risk):** the scoped compute claim holds only if detector overhead ρ_d is genuinely small (π·f_p > ρ_d) — measured at M3/M4.
- **Small-planet recall bound:** the Rₚ=1 row is intrinsically single-transit noise-limited in TESS 2-min data (the bimodality) — recovered by folding in the fallback, not conditioning. Documented at M2; reappears as a recall consideration at M4.
- **Wide 2.5 d detrend window** removes less stellar variability than a typical 0.5–1 d window — a deliberate tradeoff to preserve transits (η ≥ 0.90); watch its effect on detection SNR for active stars at M3/M4.
- **R-3:** seed-accuracy collapse under red noise (the v3 failure mode) — a real possible null, testable at M4.
- **Anti-tuning (non-negotiable #2):** TEST split untouched to date; must stay sealed until the single M4 run; all thresholds frozen on calibration + hash-sealed (Seal #2) before M4.

## 8. Next recommended actions

1. **Merge PR #5** (if still open); `git checkout main && git pull`.
2. **Recompute the M1 noise model at 2.5 d** (the M3 prerequisite) — re-run `research/m1_conditioning/m1_pipeline.py` at the finalized window (config already updated to 2.5 d).
3. **Draft `PHASE1_M3_PLAN.md`** + an **M3 frozen-parameter choices proposal** (FAR/FAP targets, `z⋆`, `θ`, `z_mono`, `N_min`, `ε`, block-bootstrap params) and **bring it for owner sign-off before sealing** (established pattern).
4. After sign-off: derive thresholds on **calibration only**, then **hash-seal (Seal #2)** into the manifest before M4. Keep TEST sealed.

## 9. Files requiring review

- **Plans/decisions:** `PHASE1_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (M0), `PHASE1_M0_CHOICES.md`, `PHASE1_M1_PLAN.md`, `PHASE1_M2_PLAN.md` (incl. §3a/§3b window-finalization + η grid), `docs/decisions/F1_DECISION_RECORD.md` (DR-001).
- **Artifacts (provenance + results):** `data/manifests/m0/m0_manifest_provenance.json` (Seal #1), `data/manifests/m1/m1_noise_summary.csv`, `data/manifests/m2/m2_eta_table.csv` + `m2_provenance.json`.
- **Tooling:** `research/m0_manifest/`, `research/m1_conditioning/`, `research/m2_injection/` (each: `m*_pipeline.py`, `config/`, `requirements.txt`).
- **Sealed (read-only):** `docs/SCIENTIFIC_HYPOTHESIS.md` v2.0, `docs/TRINETRA_X_PHASE1_VALIDATION.md` v2, `docs/TRINETRA_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md` v1.1.

## 10. Recommended startup prompt for the next session

> Resume TRINETRA-X Phase I. Read `CLAUDE.md`, then `SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-06-16.md`, then `PHASE1_M2_PLAN.md`. Confirm the seal is intact (`git diff phase1-prereg-v2` on the three sealed docs is empty) and report current state. M0, M1, M2 are done (Seal #1 = `1f2d49e1…`; detrend window finalized at 2.5 d; η gate PASS on Rₚ≥2 with the Rₚ=1 row excluded as noise-limited and 0.5/2 a documented borderline). Next is **M3 — threshold calibration → Seal #2**. First: merge PR #5 if still open and sync `main`; then recompute the M1 noise model at the 2.5 d window (the M3 prerequisite); then draft `PHASE1_M3_PLAN.md` + an M3 frozen-parameter choices proposal and bring it for my sign-off **before** deriving or sealing any thresholds. Keep the TEST split sealed until the single M4 run. Do not edit the sealed documents.
